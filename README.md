Dicoogle is an extensible, platform-independent and open-source PACS archive software that replaces the traditional centralized database with a more agile indexing and retrieval mechanism. It was designed to support automatic extraction, indexing and storage of all meta-data detected in medical images, including private DICOM attribute tags, without re-engineering or reconfiguration requirements.
